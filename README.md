Concrete
========

This repository has been split up into smaller, language-based repositories:
* [Concrete Thrift files](https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete-thrift)
* [Concrete Java library](https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete-java)
* [Concrete Python library](https://github.com/hltcoe/concrete-python)

Introduction
------------

Concrete is an attempt to map out various NLP data types in a Thrift
schema for use in projects across Johns Hopkins University.  This
standardized schema allows researchers to use a common, underlying
data model for all NLP tasks, and thus, facilitating integration
between projects.

Requirements
------------

Concrete requires the following:
* [Apache Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/)

Language-specific packages have various additional requirements.
Consult the README.md for the language of your choice at their
particular web pages.
